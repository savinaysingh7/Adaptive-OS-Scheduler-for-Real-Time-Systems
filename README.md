Overview:
The Adaptive OS Scheduler for Real-Time Systems is designed to optimize task scheduling in real-time environments. By dynamically adjusting scheduling policies based on system conditions, it enhances efficiency, reduces latency, and improves real-time task execution. This project is particularly useful for embedded systems, industrial automation, and critical real-time applications.


Problem Statement:
Traditional scheduling algorithms, such as Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) and Earliest Deadline First (EDF), are often static and fail to adapt to fluctuating workloads. This project aims to develop an adaptive scheduling mechanism that dynamically adjusts task execution strategies to improve system responsiveness and efficiency.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python 

Simulation & Analysis: Gantt Charts, Scheduling Simulations

Real-Time Operating Systems Concepts: Preemptive Scheduling, Priority-based Execution
