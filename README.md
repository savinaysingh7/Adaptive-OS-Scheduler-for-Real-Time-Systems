Adaptive OS Scheduler for Real-Time Systems

Overview:
The Adaptive OS Scheduler for Real-Time Systems is designed to optimize task scheduling in real-time environments. By dynamically adjusting scheduling policies based on system conditions, it enhances efficiency, reduces latency, and improves real-time task execution. This project is particularly useful for embedded systems, industrial automation, and critical real-time applications.

Features:
Adaptive Scheduling Algorithm - Dynamically prioritizes tasks based on workload and system constraints.

Real-Time Task Management - Ensures deadlines are met for high-priority processes.

CPU Utilization Optimization - Improves CPU efficiency by reducing idle time.

Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Modes - Supports flexible scheduling policies.

Performance Monitoring - Includes tools for analyzing execution times and system efficiency.

Problem Statement:
Traditional scheduling algorithms, such as Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) and Earliest Deadline First (EDF), are often static and fail to adapt to fluctuating workloads. This project aims to develop an adaptive scheduling mechanism that dynamically adjusts task execution strategies to improve system responsiveness and efficiency.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python 

Simulation & Analysis: Gantt Charts, Scheduling Simulations

Real-Time Operating Systems Concepts: Preemptive Scheduling, Priority-based Execution
